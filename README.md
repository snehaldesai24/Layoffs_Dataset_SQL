# 🧹 Data Cleaning using SQL (Layoff Dataset)

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** using **SQL** on a real-world **Layoff Dataset**.  
The goal is to transform raw, messy data into a **clean, structured, and accurate dataset** suitable for analysis and visualization.  
It demonstrates essential SQL data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing inconsistent formats, and validating data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Import and explore the **Layoff Dataset** in SQL.  
- Identify and remove duplicate records.  
- Handle missing or null values appropriately.  
- Standardize company names, industries, and country formats.  
- Correct data types and ensure date format consistency.  
- Prepare a final cleaned dataset ready for analysis or dashboard creation.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process
The raw dataset contained duplicates, missing values, inconsistent entries, and incorrect formats.  
Using SQL, the following steps were performed:

1. Loaded the dataset into the SQL environment.  
2. Removed duplicate records based on company and date.  
3. Filled or handled missing values for critical fields.  
4. Standardized country names, text cases, and industry categories.  
5. Fixed incorrect data types and standardized date formats.  
6. Removed invalid or impossible values in numeric columns.  
7. Created a clean version of the dataset ready for further analysis.

## 📊 Outcome
After cleaning:
- The dataset is **free from duplicates and null values**.  
- All text fields are **standardized and consistent**.  
- Dates and numeric values are **validated and correctly formatted**.  
- The dataset is **ready for analysis** using Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Pandas).
